--from before--
To get the assignment to run, simply compile everything under the /nachos/ag, /nachos/machine, /nachos/security and /nachos/threads
directory.
It is recommended to run the program using the nachos shell script located in /nachos/bin/.
Otherwise, you can run it with the command: "java nachos.machine.Machine $*".
--until here--

Task II
Task 2 does not have any testcases. As a result, there is nothing to prepare in order to run it properly. The code changes for this 
task are in UserProcess.java and UserKernel.java. The changes are consistent with those described in the design document. 
See that document for greater detail regarding precisely what's new.

Task III 
For task 3, 3 new methods called handleExec, handleJoin and handleExit were added to userProcess with regards to the guidelines 
asked for in the Phase 2 project requirements. To be specific all methods were bulletproofed to the best of my ability and all
methods handle their respective system call (i.e. exit, join and exec). No noteworthy changes beyond the project requirments 
were made to nachos in regards to task 3. For more details about task III see the design documentation detailing the project in
more detail.
Task 3 possess 5 test cases found in the test directory labeled Task3Test1-5 which utilises proc1-3 when testing the methods
of task III. For more information see the TESTCASE readme found alongside this readme.
