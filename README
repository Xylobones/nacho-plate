--from before--
To get the assignment to run, simply compile everything under the /nachos/ag, /nachos/machine, /nachos/security and /nachos/threads
directory.
It is recommended to run the program using the nachos shell script located in /nachos/bin/.
Otherwise, you can run it with the command: "java nachos.machine.Machine $*".
--until here--

Task 2 does not have any testcases. As a result, there is nothing to prepare in order to run it properly. The code changes for this 
task are in UserProcess.java and UserKernel.java. The changes are consistent with those described in the design document. 
See that document for greater detail regarding precisely what's new.
