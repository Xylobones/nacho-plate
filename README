To get the assignment to run, simply compile everything under the /nachos/ag, /nachos/machine, /nachos/security and /nachos/threads
directory.

Otherwise, you can run it with the command: "java nachos.machine.Machine $*".

By default, ThreadedKernel.selfTest() will not call test cases that do not terminate. It will also only call the first Alarm test case;
the nachos javadocs states not to run multiple alarms at once.
These test cases are commented out in ThreadedKernel.selfTest().

The ReactWater class was significantly changed from the design document due to the feedback we received on it.
